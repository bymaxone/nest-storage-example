 * `tsconfig.spec.json` transform, the `.js`-specifier mapper) but strips the
 * coverage collection and 100% threshold gate: Stryker instruments the code
 * itself and drives per-test mutant coverage, so a Jest coverage pass would only
 * duplicate work and its threshold would fail spuriously on the mutant runs.
